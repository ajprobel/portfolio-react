# Portfolio - React Framework

## Description

Every developer needs to have an easy-to-access portfolio that showcases information about themselves, examples of past work, and contact information. What better way to check all those boxes--and showcase the cumulative web development skills learned so far--than to make an interactive MERN Stack application that I can show other developers and employers!

This Portfolio application utilizes React to render front end elements on to different pages that users can interact with. Each page highlights a different aspect of what I'd like the developer community to see: an "About Me" page; a page that neatly showcases the previous projects I've worked on; a way for people to get in contact with me; lastly, my updated resume.

This was a fun way to sharpen my React skills and get more custom styling practice after spending so much time learning back end technologies. I hope you all enjoy the site, and don't hesitate to contact me with any questions/comments!

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Visit the deployed site [here!](https://dancing-florentine-44a119.netlify.app/)

Users will be greeted with an "About Me" page featuring a picture of myself along with a short section detailing my background and past experiences.

To navigate to other pages on the site, click the various buttons in the Nav bar (labeled "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume"). The currently active tab will be highlighted with a silver outline.

The Portfolio page showcases some of my past projects. Each card has a picture of the application, along with a clickable title that will direct users to the application itself. There's also a clickable GitHub icon that will take users to the GitHub repository for that project.

The Contact page has a form where users can enter their information and send me a message. **Users must fill out all sections on the form.** If there is an issue while submitting the form (invalid email, empty field), the user will be met with an error that details what needs to be fixed.

The Resume page contains a list of Full Stack Development proficiencies, as well as my full resume below. Please use the download link at the top of the page to download a PDF version of my resume.

The Footer, found at the bottom of each page, has links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram profiles.
